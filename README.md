## Setup and Installation

To run the projects in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/MasterBigDataML-DeepLearningI.git
   cd MasterBigDataML-DeepLearningI
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download the necessary datasets:**
   Place the datasets in the appropriate directories.

## Usage

Each project directory contains its own Jupyter notebooks and HTML files with specific instructions on how to run the code. Generally, you can navigate to a project directory and open the Jupyter notebook.

Example for opening a Jupyter notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook Tarea\ CNN/Alejandro_Borrego_Megias.ipynb
```
